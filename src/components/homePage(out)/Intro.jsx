      Petfinder is only a directory of homeless pets and pet adoption
      organizations. No information in Petfinder is guaranteed. Although the
      information on Petfinder is updated frequently, it is always best to call
      the facility or organization that lists the pet to insure it is still
      available and to insure the information listed in Petfinder is accurate.
      It is crucial that any pet found through an adoption service be thoroughly
      examined by a veterinarian immediately upon adoption. Any pets found,
      adopted through, or listed in Petfinder are the sole responsibility of the
      adoption organizations and/or the adopting party.
